# Badger Bash

Badger Bash is a tui monkeytype like typing test.

What's so special about it?
Ever notice how on monkeytype there's the word "program" a lot?
It appears more that you would expect, and other words you'd expect a lot more aren't there!
Badger Bash aims to solve this with real world word data, having truly random words, and the word the an excessive amount of times.

## Credits

The data for these words was not procreated by myself, but was sourced at [https://www.wordfrequency.info], I take no credit on the creation of this list.
